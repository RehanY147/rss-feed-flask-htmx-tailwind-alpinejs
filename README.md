# Building a responsive and reactive web page served using Flask, and implemented with `Jinja2`, `HTMX`, `AlpineJs` and `TailwindCSS`
- Presents blogs' RSS feeds in a custom page
- Implements pagination with "Load more" button using `htmx` to call backend and inject the resulting template in the current page without reloading the tab
- Implements reactive UI with `AlpineJs` to make the UI react to user actions like button clicks to show form without sending calls to the backend
- Uses `AlpineJs` to implement "Read" state on articles to indicate what articles have been read without realoding the page
- Uses TailwindCSS to give styling to the page
- Uses NPM to install and access JS packages for efficient file access
